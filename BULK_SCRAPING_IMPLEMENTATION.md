# Bulk Party Opposition Scraping - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview

Successfully implemented a bulk party scraping feature that searches for ALL oppositions by party name and scrapes each one sequentially, consolidating the data into a single Excel file with one row per opposition.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. New Method: `bulk_scrape_party_consolidated()`
**Location:** `web_app.py` (lines 1396-1526)

**Features:**
- Searches for all oppositions by party name
- Processes each opposition sequentially (one at a time)
- Reuses existing `scrape_opposition()` method for reliability
- Consolidates all data into ONE ROW per opposition
- Comprehensive error handling and tracking
- Progress tracking with callbacks
- Rate limiting (0.75s between oppositions)

**Returns:**
```python
{
    'party_name': str,
    'search_date': str (timestamp),
    'opposition_count': int,
    'oppositions': List[Dict],  # One dict per opposition (one row)
    'processing_stats': {
        'total_time_seconds': float,
        'time_per_opposition': float,
        'cache_hits': int,
        'cache_misses': int,
        'cache_hit_rate': float,
        'total_errors': int,
        'successful_oppositions': int
    }
}
```

### 2. Helper Method: `_consolidate_opposition_to_row()`

### 4. Streamlit UI - Tab 2: Bulk Party Search
**Location:** `web_app.py` (lines 2290-2488)

**Features:**
- Separate tab for bulk party search
- Input fields:
  - Party name (required)
  - Start date (optional, MM/DD/YYYY)
  - End date (optional, MM/DD/YYYY)
- Date validation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Comprehensive results display:
  - Summary metrics (oppositions, time, cache hit rate, errors)
  - Data preview (first 10 oppositions)
  - Download buttons (Excel + JSON)
  - Error details (expandable)
  - Complete data view (expandable)

## üéØ Key Design Decisions

### 1. Sequential Processing (No Parallelization)
**Why:** Research-grade accuracy requirement
- Each opposition processed completely before moving to next
- Easier to debug and trace errors
- Respects USPTO API rate limits (60 req/min peak, 120 req/min off-peak)
- Cache reuse is highly effective

### 2. One Row Per Opposition (Not Per Serial)
**Why:** User's specific requirement
- Each row contains ALL information for one opposition
- Comma-separated lists for multiple serials/marks
- Easy to analyze opposition-level statistics
- Excel-friendly format for pivot tables

### 3. Error Continuation (Not Failure)
**Why:** Maximize data collection
- If one opposition fails after 3 retries, continue to next
- Failed opposition gets a row with error details
- "Failed Serials" column tracks which serials had issues
- User can manually investigate failures

### 4. Cache-First Approach
**Why:** Cost and speed optimization
- Check cache before API calls
- Reuse data across oppositions (serials often repeat)
- Track cache hit rate per opposition
- Expected 70-90% hit rate after first run
- Saves ~$0.015 per cached image (Anthropic API)

### 5. Hidden Metadata Sheet
**Why:** User requested it after initial clarification
- Contains processing statistics
- Audit trail for research purposes
- Cost tracking
- Performance metrics
- Hidden by default (not cluttering main data)

## üìä Expected Performance

### Test Scenarios
| Oppositions | Avg Serials | Estimated Time | Cache Hit (First) | Cache Hit (Repeat) |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 10          | 10/opp      | ~8-12 min      | 0%                | 90%               |
| 50          | 10/opp      | ~40-50 min     | 0%                | 90%               |
| 100         | 10/opp      | ~80-100 min    | 0%                | 90%               |

**Notes:**
- Times assume peak hours (1 req/sec TSDR API limit)
- Off-peak (10pm-5am EST): ~50% faster (2 req/sec)
- Cache dramatically speeds up repeat scrapes
- Time includes: TTABVue scraping, TSDR API calls, Claude Vision classification

## üîí Error Handling & Validation

### Input Validation
- Party name: Required, min 2 characters, alphanumeric + common punctuation
- Dates: Optional, must be MM/DD/YYYY format

### Network Error Handling
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Timeout handling (60s per request)
- HTTP 429 (rate limit) detection
- Connection error recovery

### Data Validation
- Serial number format: 8 digits
- US class codes: 3 digits
- International class codes: 2 digits
- Mark type: 0-3
- Opposition result: 0/1/null

### Error Tracking
- Failed serials logged with error messages
- Failed oppositions tracked but don't stop process
- Error column in Excel for easy identification
- Detailed error messages in UI expander

## üöÄ How to Use

### Starting the Application
```bash
cd "/Users/nagavenkatasaichennu/Desktop/claude code copy 2"
streamlit run web_app.py
```

### Using Bulk Party Search (Two-Step Process)

**Step 1: Search for Oppositions**
1. Open the application
2. Click on "üì¶ Bulk Party Search" tab
3. Enter party name (e.g., "Nike Inc")
4. Optionally enter date range (MM/DD/YYYY format)
5. Click "üîç Step 1: Find Oppositions"
6. Wait for search results (usually 5-10 seconds)

**Step 2: Review and Confirm Scraping**
7. Review the number of oppositions found
8. See list of opposition numbers and filing dates
9. Check estimated processing time
10. Click "‚úÖ Confirm & Start Scraping" to proceed
11. OR click "üîÑ Cancel & New Search" to try different search terms
12. Wait for scraping to complete (progress bar shows status)
13. Review results in UI
14. Download Excel file

**If No Oppositions Found:**
- Check the spelling of the party name
- Try searching without date filters
- Verify the party has oppositions in TTABVue
- Click "üîÑ Try Another Search" to start over

### Excel File Structure
- **Sheet 1 (Opposition Data):** Main data, one row per opposition
- **Sheet 2 (Metadata):** Hidden sheet with statistics

## üìù Important Notes

### Rate Limiting
- USPTO TSDR API: 60 requests/minute (peak), 120 requests/minute (off-peak)
- TTABVue: No official API, web scraping with conservative limits
- Built-in delays: 0.75s between oppositions, 0.75s between serials

### Cache Optimization
- First run: All API calls made, data cached
- Subsequent runs: 70-90% cache hit rate
- Cache TTL: 30 days
- Significant cost savings on Anthropic API (~$0.015/image)

### Data Accuracy
- All data validated before writing
- Failed serials clearly marked
- Error messages preserved
- Plaintiff/defendant info extracted
- Mark type classification via Claude Vision API

### Limitations
- Sequential processing (no parallelization)
- Long runtime for large party lists (100+ oppositions = 1-2 hours)
- Memory accumulation (all data in memory until export)
- No partial save/resume (but errors don't stop process)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No oppositions found"
- Check party name spelling
- Try without date filters first
- Verify party has oppositions in TTABVue manually

### "Rate limit exceeded (429)"
- Wait 1 minute before retrying
- Consider running during off-peak hours (10pm-5am EST)
- Check USPTO API status page

### "Opposition failed after 3 retries"
- Check Error Message column in Excel
- Check Failed Serials column
- May be transient network issue - can retry manually
- May be invalid opposition number

### Slow Performance
- Expected for large party lists
- Run during off-peak hours for 2x speed
- Cache will speed up subsequent runs
- Consider date filtering to reduce scope

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

If needed in future, could add:
1. Async/parallel processing (trade accuracy for speed)
2. Checkpoint/resume functionality
3. Incremental Excel saves
4. Email notifications
5. Batch input (multiple parties)
6. Advanced filtering (by result, plaintiff/defendant)
7. Data analytics dashboard
8. Export to other formats (CSV, SQLite)
