# Research Format Export - User Guide

## üìã Overview

The bulk party scraper now supports **Research Format Export** - a special format designed to match your existing research Excel database format. This allows you to **directly copy-paste** scraped opposition data into your research Excel file without any manual reformatting.

## üéØ What is Research Format?

Research Format is a specific Excel layout where:
- **One row = One opposition** (not one trademark)
- Fixed metadata columns (brand_id, gvkey, company name, dates, results)
- **Alternating TM Type and Serial Number columns** for all trademarks in the opposition

### Format Structure

```
brand_id | gvkey | conm | Alt Name | Plaintiff | Marks | US GS | INT GS | Opp Start Date | Opp End Date | Result | TM Type | Serial No | TM Type | Serial No | ...
```

**Example:**
```
15011 | 3007 | BRINKER INTL INC | BRINKER INTL | 1 | 6 | 8 | 5 | 2019-10-23 | 2020-04-08 | 1 | 1 | 73100212 | 1 | 77246612 | 2 | 85400645 | 2 | 78863594 | 2 | 78855972
```

This opposition has 6 trademarks, so there are 6 pairs of (TM Type, Serial Number).

## üìä Column Definitions

### Fixed Columns (Always Present)

| Column | Description | Example | How It's Determined |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| brand_id | Brand identifier | 15011 | Entered by you (optional) |
| gvkey | Company identifier | 003007 | Entered by you (optional) |
| conm | Company name | BRINKER INTL INC | From party search name |
| Alt Name | Alternative name | BRINKER INTL | Same as company name (you can edit) |
| Plaintiff | Is plaintiff? | 1 or 0 | 1 if party is plaintiff, 0 if defendant |
| Marks | Number of trademarks | 6 | Count of serial numbers |
| US GS | Unique US classes count | 8 | Count of unique US class codes |
| INT GS | Unique Intl classes count | 5 | Count of unique international class codes |
| Opp Start Date | Opposition filing date | 2019-10-23 | From TTABVue |
| Opp End Date | Opposition end date | 2020-04-08 | From TTABVue (termination date) |
| Result | Opposition result | 1, 0, or blank | 1=Sustained, 0=Dismissed, blank=Pending |

### Dynamic Columns (Based on Number of Trademarks)

After the fixed columns, the pattern alternates:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| TM Type | Trademark type (0-3) | 1 |
| Serial No | Serial number | 73100212 |
| TM Type | Trademark type (0-3) | 1 |
| Serial No | Serial number | 77246612 |
| ... | ... | ... |

**TM Type Values:**
- **0** = No Image
- **1** = Standard Text
- **2** = Stylized/Design
- **3** = Slogan

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Handling Large Datasets
- If you have 100+ oppositions, consider downloading TSV instead of copy-pasting
- Excel may struggle with very wide pastes (oppositions with 50+ trademarks)

### 2. Filling Missing Data
- Leave brand_id and gvkey blank during export
- Fill them in your research Excel using VLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH later
- This is faster than entering them one-by-one

### 3. Plaintiff/Defendant Detection
- The system automatically detects if the searched party is plaintiff or defendant
- Based on name matching (case-insensitive)
- May not be 100% accurate if multiple parties with similar names

### 4. Data Verification
- Always verify the "Marks" count matches your expectation
- Check that "Result" values make sense (Sustained vs Dismissed)
- Review the "Failed Serials" column in Standard Format if errors occurred

### 5. Combining with Existing Data
- Paste new data at the bottom of your research Excel
- Use Excel's "Remove Duplicates" feature based on Opposition Number
- Sort by dates or company name as needed

## üîÑ Comparison: Standard vs Research Format

| Feature | Standard Format | Research Format |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Layout** | One row per opposition with comma-separated lists | One row per opposition with alternating columns |
| **Best For** | Analysis, review, data exploration | Copy-pasting into existing research database |
| **Trademark Data** | Comma-separated in cells | Separate columns for each trademark |
| **Excel Compatibility** | Good for viewing | Perfect for database-style sheets |
| **Metadata** | Hidden sheet with stats | Embedded in each row |
| **Copy-Paste** | Requires reformatting | Direct paste ready |

## üìù Example Workflow

**Scenario:** You're researching trademark oppositions for Nike Inc from 2020-2024.

1. **Search & Scrape**
   - Enter "Nike Inc"
   - Date range: 01/01/2020 to 12/31/2024
   - Find 47 oppositions
   - Scrape all (takes ~35 minutes first run, ~8 minutes repeat run)

2. **Export in Research Format**
   - Select "Research Format"
   - Enter brand_id: "12345" (if you have it)
   - Enter gvkey: "006174" (if you have it)
   - Click "Download Research Excel"

3. **Add to Database**
   - Open your research Excel
   - Scroll to the bottom row
   - Open the downloaded file
   - Copy all data rows (skip header)
   - Paste at the bottom of your research Excel
   - Save

4. **Clean Up (Optional)**
   - Remove duplicate oppositions if any
   - Fill in any missing metadata
   - Apply your Excel formatting/formulas
   - Create pivot tables for analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Data Accuracy
- All data comes directly from USPTO sources
- No manual entry or assumptions
- If a field is blank, it means USPTO didn't provide that data

### Opposition Numbers
- Opposition numbers are NOT included in the output
- Add an "Opposition Number" column in your Excel if you need to track them
- Or download Standard Format which includes opposition numbers

### Date Formats
- Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Excel may auto-convert to its default date format
- This is normal and expected

### Serial Number Formatting
- Serial numbers are 8-digit numbers
- Excel may remove leading zeros
- Format cells as "Text" to preserve leading zeros

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Some columns appear empty"
- This is normal if different oppositions have different numbers of trademarks
- Excel shows empty cells for unused TM Type/Serial columns

### "Data pastes into one column"
- Make sure you're pasting tab-separated data
- Try downloading TSV and opening in Excel instead

### "Plaintiff column shows wrong values"
- The system matches party name to determine plaintiff
- If both parties have similar names, it may be incorrect
- Manually verify and correct as needed

### "brand_id and gvkey are blank"
- These are optional fields you provide
- System cannot determine these automatically
- Fill them in after pasting into your research Excel
